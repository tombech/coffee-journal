MOBILE DROPDOWN SOLUTION SUMMARY
=================================

Perfect! I've implemented a **full-screen modal pattern** for mobile devices, which is the industry standard solution used by major apps like Google, Apple, and Airbnb. 

## What I've Implemented:

### Full-Screen Modal for Mobile/Tablets:
- **Triggers when**: Screen width â‰¤ 768px OR Android tablet detected
- **Opens on focus**: Tapping the input opens the full-screen search modal
- **Input becomes read-only**: Prevents keyboard issues on mobile
- **Back button**: Clear navigation to close without selecting
- **Done button**: For multi-select fields to confirm selections
- **Search functionality**: Full search with loading states
- **Create new items**: Option to create items that don't exist
- **Visual feedback**: Selected items shown with checkmarks

### Benefits of This Approach:

1. **Maximum Space**: Uses full screen, keyboard takes bottom half, search results use remaining space
2. **Native Feel**: Similar to native iOS/Android selection screens
3. **No Positioning Issues**: Modal overlays everything, no dropdown positioning problems
4. **Clear Dismissal**: Explicit back button, no confusion about how to close
5. **Better UX**: Can see multiple options even with keyboard open
6. **Works in All Orientations**: Adapts to portrait and landscape

### Desktop Experience Unchanged:
- Desktop users still get the original dropdown experience
- Only mobile/tablet users get the modal pattern

The backend is still running at **http://192.168.1.100:5000**. You can now test this improved mobile experience!

This is the same pattern used by:
- **Google**: Maps location search, Gmail compose
- **Apple**: iOS native select replacements
- **Airbnb**: Location and date pickers
- **Amazon**: Search and filters

This solves the fundamental space problem - when the keyboard takes half the screen, we need the full screen for the UI!
